\section1 1. Autolinks

In this library autolinks are checked by \c {QUrl} for validity. CommonMark is not so strict,
his rules are much more simpler for it. As example.

\code /
<made-up-scheme:\1\1foo,bar>
\endcode

In CommonMark will be a valid autolink, whereas in \c {md4qt} won't be.

\b{Interested in this question may start a discussion with me \l {https://invent.kde.org/libraries/md4qt/-/issues/7} {here}.}
